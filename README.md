# Stylometry Using Machine Learning

A machine learning project for classifying authors based on their writings.

## Initial Plan

-   Data Collection : https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification

-   Text Processing :
    -   Tokenization (converting into words or tokens).
    -   Stemming / Lemmatization (normalizing tokens).

-   Feature Extraction : 
    -   Classical : bag of words / n-grams / TF-IDF.
    -   Deep Learning : word embeddings.

-   Classification (better approach to train a binary classifier for each author to improve generalization):
    -   Classical : Clustering / SVM / Naive Bayes / SGD / Boosted Decision Trees / Linear Regression.
    -   Deep Learning : RNNs / FC.
